;;; Summary of the colour data format sent to the launchpad:
;;;
;;; It's easiest to split the number into two-bit "crumbs":
;;;
;;; 4r300 <- LED green, single buffer
;;; 4r030 <- LED off, copy to both buffers
;;; 4r003 <- LED red, single buffer
;;;
;;; The first crumb is the green value; the last crumb is the red
;;; value. They separately control a green and a red LED
;;; respectively. Setting a value of 1 or 2 rather than 3 dims the
;;; LED. You can get other colours by mixing red and green; eg the
;;; launchpad programmer's reference suggests 4r333 (63) for amber and
;;; 4r332 (62) for yellow.
;;;
;;; The middle crumb contains two control bits with regard to double
;;; buffering. A value of 3 copies the sent colour to both buffers,
;;; while a value of 0 only sends it to the currently updating buffer
;;; (which is not the currently displayed one). Generally you want it
;;; to be 3 for setting a single LED at a time, and 0 while updating
;;; the whole field in double-buffering mode. For other values, see
;;; the programmer's reference.
